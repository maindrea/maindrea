# Hi there! I'm Maindrea!

I'm a passionate Web Developer with a unique approach: I love committing directly to the main branch! ðŸš€



## My Development Philosophy

I believe in simplicity and efficiency. By committing directly to the main branch, I streamline my workflow and focus on delivering features and fixes faster.
While some might see this as unconventional, it works for me and keeps me agile and productive.
